# Spiderman-Learn-to-code
Help people learn to code python, where the story line is, if you code correctly, Spiderman will get to reach his home.

## Dependencies
* Pygame

## Why we made it?
We wanted to make programing easy and give an intuiton of where to use, which statements. So we designed few levels such that each of those would give a baisc understanding of those statements to the player.

### Stages
* For loop problem
* If else problem
* While problem

### Goal
Write a code which uses control statements such that the spiderman reaches the home.

### UI
 Moving from left to right
* A To Do list on the left (shows an overview of what needs to be done) </br>
* Helper functions and keywords </br>
(Functions you can use to take the information or do tasks, Eg: forward()- moves spiderman one block forward) </br>
* Stage </br>
* Code window (You cannot go backspace after going into a new line :(  ...we are working on fixing it) </br>

#### Further Imporvements
We do not compile user input for real, we just match it with the predefined string, thus if user enters extra space, or uses a different logic, it won't work. Can definately try to impove that, either by adding alternative ans keys, or by making a py interpreter using py itself (pyception!)

This project was made together in a team, which included Shubham Mukherjee, Purvesh Bane, Harsh Chandorkar and Darshan Dodia.
